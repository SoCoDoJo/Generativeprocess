# Obsidian/GitHub Index
These are a collection of patterns & practices that have emerged (from working on both the Digital Space and Wholocracy projects) for creating generative projects with the Obsidian/GitHub environment.
1. [[GenSeq - ObsidianGit New Project]]
2. [[GenSeq - ObsidianGit File Structure]]
3. [[GenSeq - ObsidianGit File Formatting]]
4. [[GenSeq - ObsidianGit Multiple Sequence]]

These are technical details about how to arrange generative sequences within Obsidian/GitHub. They do not address how to author generative sequences. On that front I can offer these initial suggestions: 
1. Start a new sequence as a numbered list within one note in the sequences folder (see [[GenSeq - ObsidianGit File Structure]]).
2. Start each list item with a tentative title (which will become the title of the transformation) followed by a description of the transformation.
3. Use this single file format to flesh out your initial thoughts, until you have an initial whole-feeling sequence.
4. Only then convert each of the transformations into separate files:
	1. Select the entire text of each transformation (title + description).
	2. Right click -> Extract Current Selection
	3. Press Ctrl  + Enter to create a new note.
	4. Copy the title note into the filename (minus disallowed characters).
	5. Convert the title within the note into a level 5 heading.
	6. Move the card from the root folder (this seems to be where new cards are created) into its proper transformations folder.
