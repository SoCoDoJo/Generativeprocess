When people are in relationship with each other and the natural world so that everyone and everything thrives, that is solidarity. When in solidarity, people recognize and embody the reality that we only exist in relation to others. We only discover and realize our gifts, and our needs are only truly fulfilled, when we are in healthy, equitable relationships with others.
